This file contains functions that generate well-structured prompts for interacting with LLaMA 3.2. These prompts guide the model to perform the prototyping tasks: 
- Automatically summarize lengthy legal documents, extracting the most important key points and decisions.
- Generate drafts of legal documents (contracts, agreements, pleadings) from customizable templates, with automatic suggestions of legal clauses.

The way a prompt is crafted can significantly influence the quality of the model's output.
